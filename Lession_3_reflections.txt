When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i am the only person working on my project, i would like to keep all my work local but 
If you are working with multiple developers, you must use remote repository as it will serve as a central repository and as it track
all your changes, so it will be easy to manage among all other developers.

why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?
I would like to pull changes whenever i want to work on the project, to make my repository up to date on requiremen t basis.
In case of automatic pull it may create collision if multiple persons are working on a single project.

diff between forks, clones, branches. when would you use one instead of another?
fork- when you copy some one else repository to your account to work on ti independently.
clones- clone is to copy github branch to local or local branch to local repository.
branches- branches is used to work on a code without changing the code itself by creating the branch.
